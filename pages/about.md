My name is Aldo Gatica, I am a software engineer from Guatemala, I studied at Universidad Rafael Land√≠var.

I have mostly worked as a Web and Android developer during my university years, but now I am more interested in working
on the latest technologies such as cloud computing and machine learning.

Currently, I am working as an automation analyst at Capgemini.
I like getting involved in tech communities, and messing around with the stuff that I learn.


Most of my projects can be found on [Github][github-link].
