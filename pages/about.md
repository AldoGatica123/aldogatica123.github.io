My name is Aldo Gatica, I am a software engineer from Guatemala, I studied at [Universidad Rafael Land√≠var][url-link].

I have mostly worked as a Web and Android developer during my university years, but now I am more interested in newer technologies.
I like getting involved in tech communities and I enjoy working in my  projects, mostly in Cloud Technologies and Machine Learning.

Feel free to join the AI community in Guatemala on [Meetup][meetup-link] and [Facebook group][facebook-link]. Also subscribe to the [Telegram channel][telegram-link] to download useful books and other resources.

Now this is my personal site, most of my projects can be found on [Github][github-link].
