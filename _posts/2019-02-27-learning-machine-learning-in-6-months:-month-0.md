title: "Learning Machine Learning in 6 Months: Month 0"  
---



Some weeks ago I found an interesting video about _"How to learn Machine Learning in 6
 months"_ and needless to say I was pretty excited about that.  

### **Roadmap: How to Learn Machine Learning in 6 Months**  
[![HTLML](https://img.youtube.com/vi/MOdlp1d0PNA/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOdlp1d0PNA "Video")  

I have been reading and watching a lot of videos about the subject but by the time this post is being written 
I haven't done any projects related to machine learning besides a bag of words program for a course at the university
and simple web scrappers.  

I have decided I **will** follow Zach Miller's advice so I can finally learn Machine Learning!

![Roadmap](https://github.com/AldoGatica123/aldogatica123.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/HTLML.png?raw=true)

### What to do

I will have to study again:
- Linear Algebra
- Calculus
- Statistics
- Probability

I have already picked a language:
- Python

### My Resources

I collected a lot of books and tutorials to help me with the ML theory so I will post about 
the ones I found useful and I will be thinking about the projects I want to make.

I have chosen the following online courses to do the next months:
- Coursera:  
    [Machine Learning][machine-01]  
    [Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization][machine-02]  
    [Deep Learning Specialization][deep-01]  
- edX:  
    [Foundations of Data Science: Computational Thinking with Python][foundations-01]  
    [Foundations of Data Science: Inferential Thinking by Resampling][foundations-02]   
    [Foundations of Data Science: Prediction and Machine Learning][foundations-03]   
- Udemy:  
    [Linear Algebra Theory and Implementation][linear-01]  
    [Machine Learning and Data Science Hands-on with Python and R][machine-03]  
- Books:  
    [Inteligencia Artificial Guatemala][books-01]

Hopefully everything will be just fine and every month I will post about my progress and challenges.

So I will do what Zach recommends to do:
