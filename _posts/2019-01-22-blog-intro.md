Welcome to my blog!

The goal for this blog is to introduce myself as a developer and show my work by giving a small description about my projects.    

As a personal challenge on each project I will list the challenges I faced during the development or while learning the technology related to it.  

_For example, this is my first time working in Jekyll. Even though I already have some experience writing in markdown I couldn't successfully edit the index page at the first try cause I didn't respect the front matter_ ðŸ˜‚  

I hope this personal project will be useful for anyone that finds it and encourage them to create resources for the community.

Soooo... my [github][github-link] and my email are below the page if you want to contact me.
