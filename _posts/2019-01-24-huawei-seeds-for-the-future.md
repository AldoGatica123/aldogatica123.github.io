title: "My Experience at Huawei Seeds for the Future 2018"  
---

Sooo in November 2018 I participated in Huawei's technology contest and I lost.  
Even though I was upset my project was not selected for the best 5, it managed to be in the best 15
and I got the experience of doing a little research for a concrete problem to improve the country.  

The objective was "How to build a safe and smart city in Guatemala", the contestants had to submit 
a project proposal using one or more of the latest technologies.  The big prize was a trip to Huawei's 
HQ in Shenzhen, China for 2 weeks, you bet I was really interested in the opportunity. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³

The first step into the contest was to make an introduction of ourselves and tell why
we should be selected by Huawei.  Thanks to one of my closest friends I got help for making
the video, he has a nice camera and good video edition skills, and here is the final product:

The next step was to send a video presenting our projects.  
Mine consisted making IoT devices for surveillance in cars assisted by computer vision algorithms, 
for more details here is the video:

I was excited when I got the email saying I got my project into the best 15. I already thought that
I lost because I didn't receive any message about the challenge until 1 am the next day after the
date they said the results were going to be published. ðŸ˜¨   

After seeing everyone's projects I was really confident I was going to be select for the China trip. ðŸ˜†  
I even went to get my passport because it had expired 8 years ago.

However, I enjoyed participating and I hope I finally get to win in the next opportunity!
